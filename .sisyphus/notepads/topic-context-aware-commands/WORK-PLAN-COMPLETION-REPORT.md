## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR USER

### Step 1: Read the Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
cat .sisyphus/notepads/topic-context-aware-commands/ONE-COMMAND-TO-COMPLETE.md
```

### Step 2: Execute the Master Orchestrator (5 minutes)

```bash
cd .sisyphus/notepads/topic-context-aware-commands
./master-test-orchestrator.sh
```

**This ONE command:**
- Guides you through all 4 tests
- Monitors your actions
- Captures evidence automatically
- Verifies success criteria
- Generates test report
- Tells you what to report back

### Step 3: Report Results (30 seconds)

**If all 4 tests pass:**
```
