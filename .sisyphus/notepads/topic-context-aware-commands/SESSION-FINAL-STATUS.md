## Remaining Work: 20 Manual UI Testing Tasks

**All 20 tasks require:**
- Access to Feishu client application
- Sending messages through Feishu UI
- Verifying bot responses in real-time
- Human judgment on results

**Tasks:**
- 4 test executions
- 16 evidence capture tasks

**Time required:** 2 minutes

---

## Why I Cannot Proceed Further

1. **Delegation System Failures:** 3 attempts, all failed with JSON parse errors
2. **No Feishu Client Access:** Cannot access Feishu desktop/mobile application
3. **No WebSocket Credentials:** Cannot send real messages to Feishu
4. **Manual UI Testing:** Genuinely requires human interaction
